A website requires the users to input a username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users. Following are the criteria for checking the password:

At least 1 letter between [a-z]
At least 1 number between [0-9]
At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
At least 1 character from [$#@]
Minimum length of transaction password: 6
Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma-separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.

Input Format:
The input consists of a single line string inputs separated by a comma(,).

Output Format:
The output consists of strings that satisfy the password condition separated by a comma(,). if there is no password that matches the condition, print "No password matches the condition".

Sample Input:
ABd1234@1, a F1#, 2w3E*, 2We3345

Sample Output:
ABd1234@1

Program:-
str = input().split(",")
l=[]
for i in str:
    s=0
    b=0
    d=0
    c=0
    if len(i)>=6 and len(i)<=12:
        for j in i:
            if j>='a' and j<='z':
                s+=1
            elif j>='A' and j<='Z':
                b+=1
            elif j>='0' and j<='9':
                d +=1
            else:
                c+=1
        if s>0 and b>0 and d>0 and c>0:
            l.append(i)
if l==[]:
    print("No password matches the condition")
else:
    print(",".join(l))
